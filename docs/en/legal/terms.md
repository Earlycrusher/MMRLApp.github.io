# Terms of Service

By downloading or using my apps (Der_Googler & DerGoogler) ("we," "us", "our", or "I"), you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before using the apps. These Terms govern your use of the apps and any services provided through them.

## Licensing and Usage

This software is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). This means:

- You **have the freedom to use**, **study**, **modify**, and **share** the software.
- You may redistribute the software, including modified versions, **under the terms of the GPLv3**.
- You may charge for distribution, offer support services, or bundle the software with other offerings, **as long as the terms of the GPLv3 are followed**.
- You are entitled to access the source code under the GPLv3 license.

The full GPLv3 license is available here: [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

Any restrictions in this document that conflict with the GPLv3 do **not apply** to the software itself and are overridden by the license.

## Third-party Services

The app may use third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to those terms where applicable.

## Data & Privacy

The app may store and process personal data provided by you to deliver its services. You are responsible for securing your device and managing access to the app. For more information, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://mmrl.dev/legal/privacy).

## Connectivity, Root Access & Device Use

Some functionality requires internet access or root permissions. We are not responsible for degraded functionality due to lack of connectivity, root access, or device issues (e.g., battery failure).

## Updates & Upgrades

We may release updates that alter app behavior or reset internal data to improve functionality. You are not required to accept updates under the GPLv3, but some features may require the latest version.

## MMRL-Repo Format

The **MMRL-Repo format** is released under a free/libre license. While you may freely use and modify it, we strongly discourage embedding advertising or monetized links within repositories using this format.

To comply with our goals for a non-commercial ecosystem, we request (though cannot enforce under GPLv3) that you:

- Avoid paywalls, subscription requirements, or monetized link shorteners when sharing our software or related content.
- Preserve original attribution and refrain from misrepresenting modified versions as official.
- Do not promote illegal activity, hate speech, or malicious code using our format.

These preferences do not restrict your rights under the GPLv3, but reflect the intended spirit of our distribution.

## Sharing and Redistribution

You are welcome to share our work under the GPLv3, which means you may:

- Host and distribute the original or modified versions, with or without payment.
- Include it in larger collections or bundles.
- Modify and redistribute the software, provided your version is also licensed under GPLv3 and you provide access to the source code.

We request that you:

- Link to our official website or repositories when possible.
- Avoid misrepresenting derivative works as official versions.
- Attribute the original authorship where applicable.

## Changes to This Terms of Service

These Terms may be updated over time. Such changes will not override or limit the freedoms granted to you under the GPLv3 license regarding the software. Any changes affecting services, third-party integrations, or our website will be communicated on this page.

**Effective Date:** 23.04.2025
